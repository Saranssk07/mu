     Note: Dowload git and set the configuration for user name & mail as typed in git hub.

Commands:

	This command is used to clone the file from Git hub to the local repository with the help
of code in git hub. (like a copy command)

2.cd <foldername>:
	To enter into the file in local repository.

To create a file in local repository and push to remote repository command:
3. git status:
	It displays a symbol U which is unmodified.

4. git add <filename>:
	again check git status:
	It displays the symbol a Which is added

To view in remote repository, which is created in local repository, use this command:
5. git commit -m "<comments typed here>":
	It will save the new file in git.

6. git push origin main :
	It will push the code in remote repository.

Shorthand command to remember :
   
	insert -> add -> commit -> push

git hub use the following command:
